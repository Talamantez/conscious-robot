ChapterView component implementation (may be out of date):


1. Imports and Component Definition:
   - Import necessary dependencies from "preact/hooks".
   - Import custom components: `ClickToEditHeading`, `ClickToEdit`, and `ClickToEditTextArea`.
   - Define the `ChapterData` component that receives a `title` prop.

2. State Management:
   - Initialize state variables using the `useState` hook for `description`, `sections`, `activeSection`, `isAddingSection`, and `isAddingSubSection`.

3. Scroll Position Handling:
   - Define functions to save and restore scroll position using `localStorage`.
   - Add event listener to save scroll position on scroll.
   - Use `useEffect` to set scroll position on component mount and cleanup the event listener on unmount.

4. Data Retrieval and Update:
   - Use `useEffect` to retrieve stored data from `localStorage` and update the component's state.
   - Update `sections` state when `isAddingSection` changes.

5. Delete Chapter:
   - Define the `deleteChapter` function to remove the chapter from `localStorage` and redirect to the home page.

6. Delete Section:
   - Define the `deleteSection` function to remove a section from the `sections` array and update `localStorage`.

7. Delete Subsection:
   - Define the `deleteSubSection` function to remove a subsection from a specific section and update `localStorage`.
   - Utilize helper functions `findSection`, `removeSubSection`, and `updateSections` to handle the deletion process.

8. Update Section Title and Description:
   - Define the `updateSectionTitle` and `updateSectionDescription` functions to update the title and description of a section in `localStorage`.

9. Update Chapter Description:
   - Define the `updateChapterDescription` function to update the chapter description in `localStorage`.

10. JSX Rendering:
    - Render the component's JSX, including the chapter title, description, and sections.
    - Use custom components like `ClickToEditHeading`, `ClickToEditTextArea`, and `ClickToEdit` for inline editing.
    - Render buttons for deleting the chapter and sections.
    - Render subsections within each section.
    - Conditionally render the `AddSection` and `AddSubSection` components based on the state.

11. `AddSection` Component:
    - Define the `AddSection` component to handle adding a new section.
    - Manage the state for the new section's title and description.
    - Define the `addSection` function to add the new section to `localStorage` and update the UI.

12. `AddSubSection` Component:
    - Define the `AddSubSection` component to handle adding a new subsection to a specific section.
    - Manage the state for the new subsection's content.
    - Define the `addSubSection` function to add the new subsection to the respective section in `localStorage` and update the UI.

13. Additional Functions:
    - Define the `updateChapterTitle` function to update the chapter title in `localStorage` and update the URL.
    - Define the `updateSubSection` function to update a subsection's content in `localStorage` and reload the page.

This breakdown separates the code into logical parts based on their functionality and responsibilities. Each part focuses on a specific aspect of the component, making it easier to understand and maintain the code.
